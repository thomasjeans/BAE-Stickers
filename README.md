# BAE Stickers
BAE Stickers is an iOS 10 sticker pack app.  Like other sticker pack apps, it allows you to send stickers to your friends via the Messages app which comes bundled with iOS.

If you're interested in making a sticker pack app, hopefully this project will help you get started or perhaps provide some inspiration.  I think you'll find the process to be incredibly simple and a lot of fun!

This app is currently available in the iOS App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bae-stickers/id1153735090?mt=8).
